# Face Mask Detector API

The Face Mask Detector API is implemented using [Emily](http://ambolt.io/emily).

To run the face mask API, execute: 
```
python api.py
```

By default, your API will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:4242.
To test if the Face Mask Detector API is running, try running: 
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:4242/api/health
```

To see the Face Mask Detector API in action, a simple [Face Mask Detector client](https://github.com/amboltio/emily-cli/tree/main/demos/face-mask-detector/face-mask-client) has been implemented.
