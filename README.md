# Emily
The Emily platform is built to help developers and teams implement production ready machine learning powered micro services fast and easily.

Learn more on how to get started with Emily in the [wiki](https://github.com/amboltio/emily-cli/wiki).

## What's new?
- Emily combines the powers of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to build a safe and consistent machine learning development environment across teams and projects.
- The ``emily build api`` command lets you build machine learning powered micro services faster and easier than ever.
- The ``emily doctor fix`` command helps you setup and install all the necessary tools for building machine learning based projects.

## Download
Download the Emily platform for free on the official [Emily website](https://ambolt.io/home-work-together/emily/).

## Installation
How to install:
* [Linux](https://github.com/amboltio/emily-cli/wiki/How-to-install-Emily-on-Linux)
* [Windows](https://github.com/amboltio/emily-cli/wiki/How-to-install-Emily-on-Windows)

## Demonstrations
The best way to get familiar with the Emily machine learning API is to get hands-on experience with pre-made demonstrations:
- [Face Mask Detector](https://github.com/amboltio/emily-cli/tree/main/demos/face-mask-detector/face-mask-detector-api): Learn how to implement a convolutional neural network for face mask detection with PyTorch and the Emily API template.
- [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/amboltio/emily-cli/tree/main/demos/linear-regression): Learn how to predict house prices with a linear regression model in the Emily API template.
- [Text Recognition](https://github.com/amboltio/emily-cli/wiki/Text-recognition): Learn how to train, evaluate and predict sentences with a fully connected PyTorch classifier implemented in the Emily API template.
