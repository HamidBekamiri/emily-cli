# Emily CLI
The Emily CLI is built to help developers and teams implement production ready machine learning powered micro services fast and easily.

### Example commands
- ``emily build`` initializes a new machine learning powered micro services faster and easier than ever.
- ``emily doctor fix`` installs and sets up all the necessary dependencies for Emily (like CUDA, Python and Docker).

### What is Emily?
Emily combines the powers of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to build stable and consistent machine learning environments for cross-team project development.

## Getting Started
### Download
Download the Emily platform for free on the official [Emily website](https://ambolt.io/home-work-together/emily/).

### Installation
**Linux**
1. Unzip the Emily executeable and run it with `$ ./emily`
2. Follow the on-screen intructions or [see detailed instructions](https://github.com/amboltio/emily-cli/wiki/How-to-install-Emily-on-Linux)

**Windows**
1. Unzip the Emily executeable and double click `emily.exe`
2. Follow the on-screen intructions or [see detailed instructions](https://github.com/amboltio/emily-cli/wiki/How-to-install-Emily-on-Windows)

**MacOS**
1. Unzip the Emily executeable and run it with `$ ./emily`
2. MacOS may block Emily - go to `Security & Privacy` to allow anyway
3. Follow the on-screen intructions or [see detailed instructions](https://github.com/amboltio/emily-cli/wiki/How-to-install-Emily-on-Mac)

### Running and Build your First Emily Service
We recommend the [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/amboltio/emily-cli/tree/main/demos/house-price-prediction) demo as a first dive into importing and running or building an Emily project from scratch.
